## Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.

Of all the friends I've hadâ€¦ you're the first. Who are those horrible orange men? Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

1. Oh God, what have I done?
2. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
3. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

### Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.

Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Ask her how her day was. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

* Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
* No, just a regular mistake.
* But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

Oh God, what have I done? With gusto. Bite my shiny metal ass. With gusto.

What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.

You know, I was God once. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Soothe us with sweet lies.

You lived before you met me?! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Your best is an idiot!

No, she'll probably make me do it. But existing is basically all I do! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

Why not indeed! Hello Morbo, how's the family? You are the last hope of the universe. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. I'll get my kit! It doesn't look so shiny to me. Actually, that's still true. Tell her she looks thin. No, she'll probably make me do it.

I'm a thing. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Who are you, my warranty?! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!
