# I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!

Why did you bring us here? Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Pansy. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. __Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?__ *Oh, I don't have time for this.* I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

## Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Soothe us with sweet lies. Take me to your leader! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

1. I'm Santa Claus!
2. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
3. Professor, make a woman out of me.

### Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?

When will that be? The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

* Now what?
* Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
* Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. What are their names? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! How much did you make me? Bender, we're trying our best.

Say it in Russian! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! We're rescuing ya. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Ummm…to eBay?

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. But existing is basically all I do!

One hundred dollars. Anyone who laughs is a communist! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

You're going to do his laundry? The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Guess again. It doesn't look so shiny to me.
